# Celeste - High Frame Rate
Celeste with uncapped frame time.

Works by monkey-patching a [single boolean](https://github.com/adamburgess/celeste-high-frame-rate/blob/b47204935dabf2da3cd9a4362a73b580e50d5475/Program.cs#L33) that caps the limit.

The developers claim it is capped because it makes speedruns more reliable. However, 99% of people aren't speedrunning. Thus, since this isn't available in the options, here it is.

Uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to patch.

Install by downloading the latest release and extracting into the game's directory.
