# Celeste - High Frame Rate
Celeste with uncapped frame time.

Works by monkey-patching a single boolean that caps the limit.

The developers claim it is capped because it makes speedruns more reliable. However, 99% of people aren't speedrunning. Thus, since this isn't available in the options, here it is.

Uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to patch.

Install by downloading the latest release and extracting into the game's directory.
